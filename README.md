  <em>Win giveaways, pass verification. Need tokens? https://tokens.sellix.io.</em>
</p>

## "how"

- Download **GoReactor** [here](https://github.com/pyp/Discord-Message-Reactor/releases/download/discord/GoReactorExe.rar).
- Optional/Recommended: <em> Purchase proxies. </em>
- Fill out the `config.json` with your desired choices
  - The emoji key can be filled with either an actual emoji `ðŸŽ‰` or the encoded identifier for an emoji, `CrossedSwords%3A981588962579738675` for custom emojis on discord.
- Fill the `input.txt` with the tokens (make sure the tokens are in the server you want them to react to).
  - The tokens must be in `username:email:password:token` format.
  - The token is only being used but that's how the tool parses the tokens which makes it easier for you to find the account you want.
- Start: `go run .` or `GoReactor.exe`.
- <em>For additional support, please join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/tokens).</em>
